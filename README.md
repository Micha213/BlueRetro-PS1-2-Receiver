# BlueRetro-PS1-2-Receiver
***A Bluetooth receiver for PS1/2 based on BlueRetro***

This is my second version of a BlueRetro receiver for the PS1 and PS2.
This allows modern bluetooth controllers to be used on the PS1/2. The receiver is designed as a single player device. It is based on DarthCloud's BuleRetro project.

In this repo you will find the gerber file for the board and the .stl data for the case. In the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/Micha213/BlueRetro-PS1-2-Receiver/wiki) you will find all the information you need to build your own receiver.
Many thanks to TharathielCB for helping with the wiki!

If you have built one of my receivers, I would be happy if you share photos of it with me on Twitter: @mi213ger
